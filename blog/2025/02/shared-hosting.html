<p>I've been recommending shared hosting for static sites for several years, and I think a few people have taken those recommendations.</p>
<p>The logic is that basically these commodity of PHP hosts have good hardware and networks for serving PHP, and serving static sites is <strong>easy</strong> as a result.  And I also used Dreamhost for over <strong>15 years</strong> -- since 2009.  So I felt confident recommending it.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Well, Oils has moved from Dreamhost to Mythic Beasts, and I probably won't go out of my way to recommend it anymore.</p>
<p>I'm now us [Mythic Beasts][], which after 6 months of experimentation, seems to be excellent.  And I hope I will stay on it for a long time.</p>
<p>But I think the general concept is.</p>

<h2>Dreamhost Problems: FastCGI, SSH, and Log Rotation</h2>
<p>Aside from CGI dying, and FastCGI dying</p>
<ul>
<li>Decaying preetty quickly!</li>
</ul>
<a name="note-i-dont-blame-them"></a>
<h3>Note: I Don't Blame Them</h3>
<p>This sounds like a big complaint.</p>
<p>But businesses</p>
<p>Also <strong>15 years</strong> is probably.  In some ways Dreamhost has been the <strong>best</strong> subscription I've had!</p>
<p>I don't think I've subscribed to <strong>anything</strong> else for 15 years!</p>
<p>I imagine:</p>
<ul>
<li>Almost no customers use FastCGI.  Mythic Beasts doesn't use FastCGI.</li>
<li>I'm sure most customers don't have cron jobs to sync <code>access.log.*.gz</code> and analyze them with Python and R.  Most people are probably using web analytics</li>
<li>The SSH thing is less forgivable IMO.  I think most people deploying PHP probably use SSH, or rsync over SSH, though I'm not entirely sure.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Alternatives</h2>
<a name="mythic-beasts"></a>
<h3>Mythic Beasts</h3>
<p>This is one  I'm actually using.</p>
<p>It has dynamic</p>
<a name="opalstack-promising"></a>
<h3>OpalStack - Promising</h3>
<ul>
<li>uwsgi is the main thing.  I don't like this</li>
</ul>
<p>I prefer <strong>process-based</strong> or <strong>exterior</strong> protocols:</p>
<ul>
<li>FastCGI</li>
<li>HTTP Daemon, e.g. gunicorn/systemd on Mythic Beasts</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>Old base image with bash 4.2

<li>Blog post in October changing this</li>
<li>Like with Dreamhost, I don't imagine that many customers care what shell they use.  This complaint is extremely particular to me.</li>

<p>This is one of the horrible &quot;screen&quot;.</p>

<h2>I'm Not Alone?</h2>
<p>I'm looking for static site hosting mainly.</p>
<p>With a little bit of dynamism.</p>

<h2>Cloud Hosting: Lack of Protocols, Lindy Effect</h2>
<p>Well I used Dreamhost for <strong>15 years</strong></p>
<p>I don't like moving between web hosts</p>

<li>However I wanted some dynamic</li>

<p>I want the model of the &quot;mildly dynamic website&quot;.  Most of my comment is static.</p>

<h2>Survey of Cloud Hosting</h2>
<p>I am thinking of this problem.</p>
<p>The apache model:</p>
<ul>
<li>Static Content</li>
<li>Dynamic content sometimes mixed in.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I just want to SSH to a Unix box :)  I guess I am in the minority.</p>
<p>I am not going to recommend shared hosting in general anymore.</p>
<p>Mythic Beasts seems very nice so far.  You can host dynamic sites there too, and I will be experimenting with that.</p>
<p>But since Iev only used them for 6 months, and not years, I am not going to make a loud recommendation :)  Everything so far has been good though.  Only issue is I had to work around access.log.</p>
