<p>It's written in Python, so the code is short and easy to change.  But we
automatically translate it to C++ with custom tools, to make it fast and small.
The deployed executable doesn't depend on Python.</p>

<h2>Contributing</h2>
<ul>
<li>Try making the <strong>dev build</strong> of Oils with the instructions on the
<a href="https://github.com/oils-for-unix/oils/wiki/Contributing">Contributing</a> page.  This should take 1 to 5 minutes if you have a Linux
machine.</li>
<li>If it doesn't, let us know.  You can post on the <code>#oil-dev</code> channel of
<a href="https://oilshell.zulipchat.com/">oilshell.zulipchat.com</a>, or file an issue on Github.</li>
<li>Feel free to grab an <a href="https://github.com/oils-for-unix/oils/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22">issue from
Github</a>.
Let us know what you're thinking before you get too far.</li>
</ul>
<a name="quick-start-on-linux"></a>
<h3>Quick Start on Linux</h3>
<p>After following the instructions on the <a href="https://github.com/oils-for-unix/oils/wiki/Contributing">Contributing</a> page, you'll have a
Python program that you can quickly run and change!  Try it interactively:</p>
<pre><code>bash$ bin/osh

osh$ name=world
osh$ echo &quot;hello $name&quot;
hello world
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Try running a shell script you wrote with <code>bin/osh myscript.sh</code>.</li>
<li>Try <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html#YSH">YSH</a> with <code>bin/ysh</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let us know if any of these things don't work!  <a href="http://travis-ci.oilshell.org/">The continuous
build</a> tests them at every commit.</p>
<a name="dev-build-vs-release-build"></a>
<h3>Dev Build vs. Release Build</h3>
<p>Again, note that the <strong>developer build</strong> is <strong>very different</strong> from the release
tarball.  The <a href="https://github.com/oils-for-unix/oils/wiki/Contributing">Contributing</a> page describes this difference in detail.</p>
<p>The release tarballs are linked from the <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/">home
page</a>.  (Developer builds don't work on OS X, so use
the release tarballs on OS X.)</p>
<a name="important-we-accept-small-contributions"></a>
<h3>Important: We Accept Small Contributions!</h3>
<p>Oils is full of <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/">many ideas</a>, which may be
intimidating at first.</p>
<p>But the bar to contribution is very low.  It's basically a medium size Python
program with many tests, and many programmers know how to change such programs.
It's great for prototyping.</p>
<ul>
<li>For OSH compatibility, I often merge <strong>failing <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html#spec-test">spec
tests</a></strong>.  You don't even
have to write code!  The tests alone help.  I search for related tests with
<code>grep xtrace spec/*.test.sh</code>, where <code>xtrace</code> is a shell feature.</li>
<li>You only have to make your code work <strong>in Python</strong>.  Plain Python programs
are easy to modify.  The semi-automated translation to C++ is a separate
step, although it often just works.</li>
<li>You can <strong>influence the design</strong> of <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/cross-ref.html#YSH">YSH</a>.  If you have an itch to
scratch, be ambitious.  For example, you might want to show us how to
implement <a href="https://github.com/oils-for-unix/oils/issues/843">nonlinear pipelines</a>.</li>
</ul>
<a name="i-aim-for-24-hour-response-time"></a>
<h3>I aim for 24 hour response time</h3>
<p>Please feel free to ping <code>andychu</code> on Zulip or Github if you're <strong>waiting</strong> for
a pull request review!  (or to ask questions)</p>
<p>Usually I can respond in 24 hours. I might be traveling, in which case I'll
respond with something like <em>I hope to look at this by Tuesday</em>.</p>
<p>I might have also <strong>missed</strong> your Github message, so it doesn't hurt to ping
me.</p>
<p>Thank you for the contributions!</p>
<a name="docs"></a>
<h3>Docs</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/oils-for-unix/oils/wiki">Wiki</a> has many developer docs.  Feel
free to edit them.  If you make a major change, let us know on Zulip!</p>
<p>There are also READMEs in some subdirectories, like <code>opy/</code> and <code>mycpp/</code>.</p>
<p>If you're confused, the best thing to do is to ask on Zulip and someone should
produce a pointer and/or improve the docs.</p>
<p>Docs for <strong>end users</strong> are linked from each <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/releases.html">release
page</a>.</p>
<a name="repository-structure"></a>
<h2>Repository Structure</h2>
<p>Try this to show a summary of what's in the repo and their line counts:</p>
<pre><code>$ metrics/source-code.sh overview
</code></pre>
<p>(Other functions in this file may be useful as well.)</p>
<a name="a-collection-of-interpreters"></a>
<h3>A Collection of Interpreters</h3>
<p>Oils is naturally structured as a set of mutually recursive parsers and
evaluators.  These interpreters are specified at a high-level: with regular
languages, Zephyr ASDL, and a statically-typed subset of Python.</p>
<pre><code>bin/              # Main entry points like bin/osh (source in bin/oils_for_unix.py)
frontend/         # Input and lexing common to OSH and YSH
osh/              # OSH parsers and evaluators (cmd, word, sh_expr)
ysh/              # YSH parser and evaluator
data_lang/        # Languages based on JSON
core/             # Other code shared between OSH and YSH
builtin/          # Builtin commands and functions
pyext/            # Python extension modules, e.g. libc.c
pylib/            # Borrowed from the Python standard library.
tools/            # User-facing tools, e.g. the osh2oil translator
display/          # User interface
</code></pre>
<a name="dsls-code-generators"></a>
<h3>DSLs / Code Generators</h3>
<p>Here are the tools that transform that high-level code to efficient code:</p>
<pre><code>asdl/             # ASDL implementation, derived from CPython
pgen2/            # Parser Generator, borrowed from CPython
mycpp/            # Experimental translator from typed Python to C++.
                  # Depends on MyPy.  See mycpp/README.md
pea/              # Perhaps a cleaner version of mycpp
opy/              # Python compiler in Python (mycpp/ will replace it)
</code></pre>
<a name="native-code-and-build-system"></a>
<h3>Native Code and Build System</h3>
<p>We have native code to support both the dev build (running under CPython) and
the <code>oils-for-unix</code> build (pure C++):</p>
<pre><code>NINJA-config.sh   # Generates build.ninja

build/            # High level build
  NINJA-steps.sh
  NINJA_main.py   # invoked by NINJA-config.sh
  NINJA_subgraph.py
  oil-defs/       # Files that define our slice of CPython.
  py.sh           # For development builds, running CPython
cpp/              # C++ code which complements the mycpp translation
  NINJA-steps.sh
  NINJA_subgraph.py
mycpp/            # Runtime for the translator
  NINJA-steps.sh
  NINJA_subgraph.py

prebuilt/         # Prebuilt files committed to git, instead of in _gen/

Python-2.7.13/    # For the slow Python build

# Temp dirs (see below)
_bin/
_build/
_gen/
_test/
</code></pre>
<a name="several-kinds-of-tests"></a>
<h3>Several Kinds of Tests</h3>
<p>Unit tests are named <code>foo_test.py</code> and live next to <code>foo.py</code>.</p>
<pre><code>test/             # Test automation
  gold/           # Gold Test cases
  gold.sh         
  sh_spec.py      # shell spec test framework
  spec.sh         # Types of test runner: spec, unit, gold, wild
  unit.sh         
  wild.sh
testdata/
spec/             # Spec test cases
  bin/            # tools used in many spec tests
  testdata/       # scripts for specific test cases
  stateful/       # Tests that use pexpect
</code></pre>
<a name="dev-tools-and-scripts"></a>
<h3>Dev Tools and Scripts</h3>
<p>We use a lot of automation to improve the dev process.  It's largely written in
shell, of course!</p>
<pre><code>benchmarks/       # Benchmarks should be run on multiple machines.
metrics/          # Metrics don't change between machines (e.g. code size)
client/           # Demonstration of OSH as a headless server.
deps/             # Dev dependencies and Docker images
devtools/         # For Oils developers (not end users)
  release.sh      # The (large) release process.
  services/       # talk to cloud services
demo/             # Demonstrations of bash/shell features.  Could be
                  # moved to tests/ if automated.
  old/            # A junk drawer.
web/              # HTML/JS/CSS for tests and tools
soil/             # Multi-cloud continuous build (e.g. sourcehut, Github)
</code></pre>
<a name="temp-dirs"></a>
<h3>Temp Dirs</h3>
<p>Directories that begin with <code>_</code> are <strong>not</strong> stored in <code>git</code>.  The dev tools
above create and use these dirs.</p>
<pre><code>_bin/             # Native executables are put here
  cxx-dbg/
_build/           # Temporary build files
_cache/           # Dev dependency tarballs
_devbuild/        # Generated Python code, etc.
_gen/             # Generated C++ code that mirrors the repo
  frontend/
_release/         # Source release tarballs are put here
  VERSION/        # Published at oilshell.org/release/$VERSION/
    benchmarks/
    doc/
    metrics/
    test/
      spec.wwz
      wild.wwz
      ...
    web/          # Static files, copy of $REPO_ROOT/web
      table/
_test/            # Unit tests, mycpp examples
  tasks/

  ...
</code></pre>
<a name="build-dependencies-in-oil_deps"></a>
<h3>Build Dependencies in <code>../oil_DEPS</code></h3>
<p>These tools are built from shell scripts in <code>soil/</code>.  The <code>oil_DEPS</code> dir is
&quot;parallel&quot; to Oils because it works better with container bind mounds.</p>
<pre><code>../oil_DEPS/
  re2c/           # to build the lexer
  cmark/          # for building docs
  spec-bin/       # shells to run spec tests against
  mypy/           # MyPy repo
  mycpp-venv/     # MyPy binaries deps in a VirtualEnv

  py3/            # for mycpp and pea/
  cpython-full/   # for bootstrapping Oils-CPython
</code></pre>
<a name="build-system-for-end-users-version"></a>
<h3>Build System for End Users version.</h3>
<p>These files make the slow &quot;Oils Python&quot; build, which is very different than the
<strong>developer build</strong> of Oils.</p>
<pre><code>Makefile
configure
install
</code></pre>
<p>These files are for the C++ <code>oils-for-unix</code> tarball (in progress):</p>
<pre><code>_build/
  oils.sh
</code></pre>
<a name="doc-sources"></a>
<h3>Doc Sources</h3>
<pre><code>doc/              # A mix of docs
doctools/         # Tools that use lazylex/ to transform Markdown/HTML
lazylex/          # An HTML lexer which doctools/ builds upon.
