<p>This is a follow-up to <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2024/06/cgi.html">Comments on Scripting, CGI, and FastCGI</a>, from June (<a href="https://lobste.rs/s/saqp6t/comments_on_scripting_cgi_fastcgi">lobste.rs comments</a>).</p>
<p>I mentioned problems with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DreamHost">Dreamhost</a>, and described how the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface">CGI</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FastCGI">FastCGI</a> protocols are dying.</p>
<p>I gave up on FastCGI, but I'm <strong>not</strong> giving up on lightweight <strong>scripting</strong> for the web!  That's one reason I'm still using shared hosting.</p>
<p>I just finished migrating <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2024/12/new-domain.html">our new</a> <code>oils.pub</code> domain from Dreamhost to another shared host, <a href="https://www.mythic-beasts.com/">Mythic Beasts</a>.  This post has comments on my experiences, and other services I looked at.</p>

<h2>What is Shared Hosting?</h2>
<p>I've been using and recommending shared hosting for many years, but I've noticed that programmers who &quot;grew up&quot; with the cloud don't have a <strong>mental model</strong> of it.</p>
<p>They don't think of Unix as a <strong>multi-user</strong> system; they think of it as a component you put inside virtual machines or containers!</p>
<hr />
<p>For example, I wrote this <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32731048">comment</a> on a 2022 article about serving static files:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What's wrong with shared hosting? ...</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I think the industry (or part of a generation of programmers) somehow collectively forgot that it exists</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Shared hosting is a Linux box with a web server that someone ELSE manages. You get an SSH login, and you can use git and rsync.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It's associated with PHP hosting, but it is perfect for static sites.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>...</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>FWIW I also have a Linux VPS with nginx and a HTTPS certificate, but it's a pain. I much prefer using shared hosting for things I want to be reliable</p>
</blockquote>
<a name="does-it-still-make-sense"></a>
<h3>Does It Still Make Sense?</h3>
<p>I've been making this argument for awhile, but I should add some caveats.  In <strong>theory</strong>, shared hosting still makes sense:</p>
<ul>
<li>A machine running a <strong>single</strong> Linux kernel can easily serve 1000 web sites.  You don't need 1000 virtualized kernels.
<ul>
<li>Operating systems and server hardware have both gotten much better in the last 20 years.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Static</strong> site generators like <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> became popular around 2010, as did client-side <strong>JavaScript</strong>, package managers, and bundlers.
<ul>
<li>These sites may have no back end, or they may have a <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2024/06/cgi.html#the-demise-of-the-mildly-dynamic-website">&quot;mildly dynamic&quot;</a> back end, with light scripting.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But in <strong>practice</strong>, it seems that decent quality shared hosting no longer a commodity.</p>
<p>PHP hosting is still a commodity, but <strong>Unix</strong> hosting is not.</p>
<hr />
<p>My comment above may have over-generalized from Dreamhost to all shared hosting services.  I've used Dreamhost since 2009 (15 years!), and they had competent Unix system administration, and fast hardware and networks.</p>
<p>But I now suspect the Unix part was <strong>accidental</strong> — it's a layer that runs PHP, not something that most customers care about.</p>
<p>Shared hosting did acquire a  reputation for a &quot;race to the bottom&quot; in the early 2000's.  In the 2010's, many shared hosting companies were acquired and &quot;optimized&quot;, or shut down.</p>
<p>So there don't appear to be as many alternatives to Dreamhost as I thought.</p>

<a name="background-why-we-migrated"></a>
<h2>Background: Why We Migrated</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2024/06/cgi.html">In June</a>, I mentioned that Dreamhost moved my account to a new server, and it no longer reliably supports FastCGI.</p>
<p>It has a new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cgroups">cgroups</a> configuration that interferes with FastCGI processes.  Moreover, the server would also kill my SSH processes, so I couldn't debug the problem!</p>
<hr />

<p>Support didn't tell me what the problem was, but I found a way to drastically reduce the load on the site.</p>
<p>There were many spammy crawlers (including AI crawlers) hitting dynamic pages, so I disallowed them via <code>robots.txt</code>.  That made the server more responsive, and I thought it would fix the stability problems.</p>
<p>But problems persisted, despite having almost <strong>zero</strong> traffic to dynamic pages.  I mentioned that last month: <a href="../01/first.html#appendix-dreamhost-ssh-has-become-unreliable">Appendix: Dreamhost SSH Has Become Unreliable</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>The last straw was that log rotation and compression on <code>oils.pub</code> didn't work, even though it works on my other domains.  </p>
<p>I contacted support, and they said they fixed it.</p>
<p>A week later, it broke again.  Then they said that it may not be looked at for several months. That is, <strong>Won't Fix</strong>.</p>
<a name="i-dont-blame-dreamhost"></a>
<h3>I Don't Blame Dreamhost</h3>
<p>This sounds like a big complaint, but I'm not too surprised.  I think shared hosts make money from <strong>PHP</strong> hosting, not <strong>Unix</strong> hosting.  I imagine that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Very few Dreamhost customers use FastCGI.  It's barely documented anymore.
<ul>
<li>Mythic Beasts doesn't recommend FastCGI either.</li>
<li>Exception: I heard from Nick Fagerlund, who <a href="https://roadrunnertwice.dreamwidth.org/596983.html">uses FastCGI in Rust on Dreamhost</a>.  This included a tip about not accidentally starting 128 threads for the 128 cores on the Dreamhost server!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Most customers don't have cron jobs to sync <code>access.log.*.gz</code> and analyze them with Python and R.
<ul>
<li>I imagine that most of them use JavaScript analytics, if any.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What's less forgivable is the continued SSH flakiness, and the lack of support on that issue.  I think PHP deployment still relies on SSH/rsync, but I'm not sure.</p>
<hr />
<p>Anyway, I had a great service from Dreamhost for 15 years, so I'm not too disappointed.  I think that's the longest subscription I've <strong>ever</strong> had, so you could argue they were the most reliable company.</p>
<p>It took some time to migrate <code>oils.pub</code>, but in the end, it was good for the site.  I cleaned up some tech debt accumulated over 8 years.</p>

<a name="interlude-should-i-use-a-cloud-service"></a>
<h2>Interlude: Should I Use a Cloud Service?</h2>
<p>I spent a lot of time <strong>faffing</strong> with the migration:</p>
<ol>
<li>Setting up subdomains for little apps</li>
<li>Tweaking Apache web server config files</li>
<li>Re-wrapping and re-deploying Python WSGI apps</li>
<li>Accounting for differences in <code>access.log</code></li>
<li>Writing deployment scripts, which account for different dir structures</li>
</ol>
<p>It definitely crossed my mind that I'm <strong>old</strong> and should use something more modern :-)</p>
<p>After all, I recently recommended <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> to a contributor, for a purely static site, and that turned out well.</p>
<hr />
<p>But then I looked at what other people have used for hosting, like:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/hosting/">https://simonwillison.net/tags/hosting/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And I don't see an obvious, stable thing I'm missing.  I see some of the long evolution I've gone through:</p>
<ol>
<li>CGI</li>
<li><code>mod_wsgi</code> (a shared library in Apache)</li>
<li>Google App Engine</li>
<li>Plain HTTP with gunicorn, on a VPS</li>
<li>FastCGI, on shared hosting</li>
<li>uwsgi (discussed below)</li>
</ol>
<p>My conclusion is that web and cloud hosting is <strong>not</strong> very stable, at least if you care whether things work in 5 or 10 years.</p>
<p>Partly, this is a Python problem.  PHP definitely does better.  (I even wrote PHP for the first time in 2021 to understand this space better.  I liked it, but I'm more likely to use Python and Go in the future.)</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://xeiaso.net/blog/rip-heroku/">The Legacy of Heroku's Free Tier</a> also resonates with me.  There's something missing in the market.</li>
<li>I also find it comforting that other have found hosting a long-lived blog nontrivial!
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2016/12/09/rip-citydesk/">RIP CityDesk</a>, by Joel Spolsky (2016)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>So it's not just me?  I don't think there are that many great options.</p>
<p>The end of this this post will talk more about cloud services, but let's talk about <strong>shared hosting</strong> first.  If you're not familiar with it, my experiences might help you understand what it is.</p>
<p>You get a non-root Unix account with a web server, but you don't have to maintain and patch it.  The hosting provider maintains the server for dozens or hundreds of customers.</p>


<a name="mythic-beasts-real-unix-hosting"></a>
<h2>Mythic Beasts - Real Unix Hosting</h2>
<p>This site now runs on Mythic Beasts, basically because they are a Unix host, not just a PHP host.</p>
<ul>
<li>They allow you to run persistent HTTP servers, supervised with <code>systemd</code>: <a href="https://www.mythic-beasts.com/support/hosting/python">Mythic Beasts: Hosting Python</a>
<ul>
<li>This is unique among shared hosts!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I was also able to ask for a Postgres DB, in addition to the default MySQL DB.</li>
<li>The support has been very good so far, and this is <a href="https://www.mythic-beasts.com/blog/2022/10/21/the-secret-to-great-technical-support-no-support-staff/">apparently intentional</a>!</li>
</ul>
<p>The only downside I've found is that the log rotation scheme is not friendly for backups and offline analysis.  It would be nicer if the files were immutably named like <code>access.log.2025-02-04.gz</code>, rather than an ever-rotating <code>access.log.2.gz</code>.</p>
<p>I worked around this with a shell script, of course.  (We continue to avoid burdening your computer with third party JavaScript analytics.)</p>

<a name="other-hosts"></a>
<h2>Other Hosts</h2>
<p>Here are some impressions of other shared hosts I tried.  These are just my <strong>opinions</strong>; I'm not trying to do a comprehensive &quot;review&quot; of different services.</p>
<a name="a2hosting-how-bad-can-it-be"></a>
<h3>A2Hosting - How Bad Can It Be?</h3>
<p>I somehow got the impression that this company had fast hardware and networks, like Dreamhost.</p>
<p>But I underestimated how bad the control panel software could be.  I don't remember everything that happened, but I had a hard time from the start, setting up a simple subdomain.  This was easy on all the other hosts.</p>
<p>It reminded me that shared hosting was a &quot;race to the bottom&quot;.  I quickly cancelled and abandoned this account, wasting $30 or so.</p>
<a name="opalstack-promising"></a>
<h3>OpalStack - Promising</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.opalstack.com/">OpalStack</a> is a unique shared host that also supports Python, not just PHP.  It does so via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UWSGI">uWSGI</a>, rather than plain HTTP servers:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.opalstack.com/topic-guides/python/">https://docs.opalstack.com/topic-guides/python/</a></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>But I find the <code>uwsgi</code> architecture odd, which I mentioned in June:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2024/06/cgi.html#contrast-gateway-interfaces-that-arent-unix-y">Contrast: Gateway Interfaces That Aren't Unix-y
</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I just looked at the official docs — <a href="https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Protocol.html">The uwsgi Protocol</a> — and this confirms that it's a truly <strong>bizarre</strong> protocol.  It contains affordances for <strong>every</strong> language it supports:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="5">
<li>Standard PSGI request (Perl)</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="6">
<li>Standard LUA/WSAPI request</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="7">
<li>Standard RACK request (Ruby)</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="8">
<li>Standard JVM request for The JWSGI interface and The Clojure/Ring JVM request handler</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="9">
<li>Standard Running CGI script</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>...</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="14">
<li>Standard Running PHP scripts</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol start="15">
<li>Standard The Mono ASP.NET plugin request</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>...</p>

<p>Now what if it needs to support Go or Rust?</p>
<p>The whole point of protocols and interchange formats is that they should be <strong>language-independent</strong>.  They can be re-implemented many times.</p>
<p>A standard should be an <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2022/02/diagrams.html">narrow waist, aka an M x N waist</a>.  But uWSGI is a tightly-coupled architecture and large protocol.  (Docker also suffers from related problems.)</p>
<hr />
<p>This isn't really a knock on OpalStack, because many people seem to recommend uWSGI.  I guess it's what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nginx">nginx</a> supports.</p>
<p>But for now, I'll stick to plain HTTP servers.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I still have the OpalStack account, and will continue using it.</p>
<a name="nearlyfreespeech-freebsd"></a>
<h3>NearlyFreeSpeech - FreeBSD</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/">NearlyFreeSpeech</a> usually comes up when I mentioned shared hosting.  I used it briefly a few years ago.</p>
<p>I was surprised that it was based on FreeBSD!  I use Linux on my local machines, and I prefer my remote machines to be the same.</p>
<p>It also has cloud-like usage-based pricing, which I found complex.  A fixed monthly fee seems simpler.</p>
<hr />
<p>But overall, it seems like a great service, and I hope they continue to grow.</p>
<a name="others"></a>
<h3>Others</h3>
<p>Back in June, a reader mentioned UberSpace, a German host which looks nice:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://uberspace.de/en/">https://uberspace.de/en/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I haven't used it though.</p>


<a name="not-that-many-options"></a>
<h2>Not That Many Options</h2>
<p>I also glanced at the docs of <strong>all</strong> the shared hosts I could find, like Hostinger, HostGator, IONOS, etc.  But again, I think they're better thought of as PHP hosts, not <strong>Unix</strong> hosts.</p>
<p>They don't really support Python, and definitely don't support persistent HTTP / FastCGI servers.</p>
<p>So I'm glad I found Mythic Beasts and OpalStack.  But overall, the options seem <strong>thin</strong>.  Unix hosting is no longer a commodity.</p>
<hr />
<p>The situation reminds me a bit of <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17083976">this comment</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ex Amazon here. Most grumpy system engineers did not disappear: we got hired by Google/Amazon/etc to build large-scale infrastructure... and sometimes sell it back to you as a service.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is, I think it's hard for hosting companies to find skilled Unix administrators.  The cloud has made those skills desirable, and &quot;scalable&quot;.</p>
<p>My memory is that SREs at Google (site reliability engineers) started to earn as much or more than than SWEs (software engineers) around 2010 or so.  And those were the early days of the cloud, which has grown a lot in 15 years.</p>
<a name="whats-wrong-with-cloud-hosting"></a>
<h2>What's Wrong With Cloud Hosting?</h2>

<p>Now let's return to the question of whether cloud services are a good alternative to shared hosting.</p>
<p>Practically speaking, I see two problems with most cloud services:</p>
<ol>
<li>Lack of open <strong>protocols</strong>, which implies a tight coupling of the app and the platform.</li>
<li>Lack of <strong>stability</strong>, over say a 10 year period, mostly due to the business model.
<ul>
<li>Concretely, the Oils blog is now 8 years old, and people still read posts from years ago.   The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect">Lindy Effect</a> suggests that I should pick hosting services that were around <strong>before</strong> Oils!  Otherwise, they might be gone before we're gone.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>How does this compare with shared hosting?</p>
<ul>
<li>As mentioned, Dreamhost lasted for 15 years.</li>
<li>I was able to migrate from Dreamhost to Mythic Beasts pretty easily, because I use each service as a <strong>Unix</strong> machine.  (Though certainly there are things to improve, like Apache config files.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Let me elaborate a bit on the first point.</p>
<a name="lack-of-protocols"></a>
<h3>Lack of Protocols</h3>
<p>Most cloud services seem to suffer from the same problem as uWSGI: they have special support for each language.</p>
<p>This applies to &quot;PaaS&quot; aka &quot;serverless&quot; products, discussed <a href="https://www.oilshell.org/blog/2024/06/cgi.html">in the June post</a>.  It would be nice if we had a modern version of CGI and FastCGI.  They are protocols that can be implemented in any language.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Honest question</strong>: if you're using a newer language <a href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig</a> or <a href="/cross-ref.html?tag=YSH#YSH">YSH</a>, how do you plug it into these cloud services?</p>
<p>When I look at these pages, I see a lot of &quot;canned&quot; solutions, but no protocols.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/more-frameworks">https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/more-frameworks</a></li>
<li><a href="https://render.com/docs/#quickstarts">https://render.com/docs/#quickstarts</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Heroku seems better, and I've circulated their <a href="https://12factor.net/">Twelve Factor App</a> page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have a clean contract with the underlying operating system, offering maximum portability between execution environments;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="link-box">
<p>My submission of</p>
<p><a class="u-url" href="https://12factor.net/" rel="ugc noreferrer">The Twelve-Factor App (2011)</a> (<code>12factor.net</code> via lobste.rs) <br/>    20 points, <a role="heading" aria-level="2" href="https://lobste.rs/s/ksbcmq/twelve_factor_app_2011">              24 comments</a> on 2024-07-08</p>
</div>
<p>Unfortunately, Heroku was swallowed by Salesforce before it reached its full potential.  I suspect that they've since lost some software development capacity, and that's why they're moving towards Kubernetes and Docker:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://hello.heroku.com/next-generation-sign-up">https://hello.heroku.com/next-generation-sign-up</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.heroku.com/languages">https://www.heroku.com/languages</a></li>
</ul>

<a name="a-hosting-platform-should-be-specified-like-an-operating-system"></a>
<h3>A Hosting Platform Should Be Specified Like an Operating System</h3>
<p>Wouldn't it be silly if Unix came with a <strong>canned</strong> set of programming languages?  What if you had to <strong>modify the kernel</strong> to support a new one?</p>
<p>Moreover, imagine that each Unix machine had incompatible syscalls.</p>
<p>That's essentially the current situation with the cloud.</p>
<hr />
<p>The mechanisms that make Unix language-independent aren't hard:</p>
<ul>
<li>It has the concept of <strong>executable files</strong>, e.g. ELF files on Linux
<ul>
<li>They're used for C, C++, Fortran, Rust, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It has the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_%28Unix%29">shebang line</a> for scripts.
<ul>
<li>Used for Perl, Python, Ruby, bash, <a href="/cross-ref.html?tag=OSH#OSH">OSH</a>, etc.</li>
<li>This makes it relatively easy to make a new shell, like <a href="/cross-ref.html?tag=YSH#YSH">YSH</a>.  A YSH script is a text file that starts with <code>#!/usr/bin/env ysh</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface">CGI</a> is also a very simple concept.</p>
<hr />
<p>So I think it's time to think of the cloud as a real operating system, not <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24165445">a bunch of unstable services</a>.  I may return to these ideas later.</p>

<a name="philosophy-quotes"></a>
<h2>Philosophy / Quotes</h2>
<p>Here are a couple quotes related to lightweight scripting.  <a href="https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html">My first impressions of web3</a> (2022) says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We should try to reduce the burden of building software.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>At this point, software projects require an enormous amount of human effort. Even relatively simple apps require a group of people to sit in front of a computer for eight hours a day, every day, forever ...</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As long as software requires such concerted energy and so much highly specialized human focus, I think it will have the tendency to serve the interests of the people sitting in that room every day rather than what we may consider our broader goals.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I think changing our relationship to technology will probably require making software easier to create, but in my lifetime I’ve seen the opposite come to pass.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I think distributed systems have a tendency to exacerbate this trend by making things more complicated and more difficult, not less complicated and less difficult.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So if we want to avoid software complexity, and huge teams of cloud engineers, then we might start with commodity hardware and Unix kernels.  They've both gotten faster and more capable in the last 20 years.</p>
<p>The Unix shell is also a good place to start!</p>

<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41737740">My comment</a> on the <strong>essence</strong> of Unix is also relevant:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I generally agree with this article in that PROGRAMMABILITY is the core of Unix, and it is why I've been working on <a href="https://oils.pub/">https://oils.pub/</a> for many years</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>However I think the counterpoint is maybe a programming analog of Doctorow's &quot;Civil War on General Purpose Computing&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>...</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Unix/shell version of that is that valuable and non-trivial logic/knowledge will be hidden in cloud services, often behind a YAML interface.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And your job is now to LLM the YAML that approximates what you want to do</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(I don't want to use LLMs like that, but I also think that we're learning good ways to use them.)</p>

<a name="conclusion"></a>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I just want write some scripts and SSH to a beefy Unix box :-)  I don't want to maintain kernels, web servers, or SSL certificates.</p>
<p>I'm not sure I'll recommend shared hosting <em>in general</em> anymore, because it isn't a commodity.</p>
<p>But I'm glad that I found more than one high quality service.  Draw your own conclusions, and <a href="https://oilshell.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/392989-blog-comments/topic/Comments.20on.20Shared.20Unix.20Hosting.20vs.2E.20the.20Cloud">let me know</a> if I missed anything!</p>

<h2>Appendix: Some Cloud Services</h2>
<p>I'll mention a few services here, so readers don't think I'm not aware of them.</p>
<p>I should also mention that I worked at Google for over a decade, while the cloud was &quot;being formed&quot;, so I have a sense of the coding and architecture horrors that lie in these platforms.  (For example, in the Kubernetes service, 3 and a half control planes stack on top of each other.)</p>
<p>Static sites / CDN:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> - as mentioned, I've recommended it for static sites</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netlify">Netlify</a> - a San Francisco company, founded in 2014</li>
<li><a href="https://pages.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare Pages</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I should also mention <a href="https://srht.site/">Sourcehut Pages</a>. We use Sourcehut, and I like what they're doing, so I should try it.  Though my current problem is not just static content.  (Since Sourcehut is open source, it would be cool to add dynamic page hosting to it!)</p>
<p>Apps / Platform as a Service:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroku">Heroku</a>
<ul>
<li>As mentioned, it was swallowed by Salesforce</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://render.com/">Render: Cloud Application Platform</a>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://render.com/docs/render-vs-heroku-comparison">Render vs. Heroku</a> says that Heroku doesn't have special affordances for static pages, which is a reasonable point.  I like the Apache-style mix of static and dynamic, i.e. &quot;mildly dynamic&quot;.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vercel">Vercel</a>
<ul>
<li>Started in 2015 as ZEIT</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://platform.sh/">platform.sh</a> - Any opinions on this one?</li>
<li><a href="https://railway.com/">Railway</a> - ditto, any opinions?</li>
</ul>
<p>I think many of these companies don't meet my &quot;Lindy Effect&quot; criteria.  Being <strong>old</strong> has two advantages: platform stability, and business model stability (compared to being VC-funded).</p>
<hr />
<p>I think of &quot;serverless&quot; as a rebrand of &quot;PaaS&quot;.  They seem to suffer from the &quot;SDK problem&quot;:</p>
<ul>
<li>AWS Lambda</li>
<li>Google Cloud Functions</li>
</ul>
<p>Cloud hardware / CDNs:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://fly.io/">fly.io</a> - Deploy app servers close to your users
<ul>
<li>I like their blog, and their low-level approach.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>IaaS:</p>
<ul>
<li>AWS, GCE, Azure
<ul>
<li>These more geared toward big teams, not lightweight scripting.</li>
<li>I would avoid platforms that charge for egress, but have free ingress. They want to lock you in!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Again, let me know if you've had good experiences with scripting in the cloud!  I host little apps to resize images, scrape web content, my personal wiki, and a few cron jobs.</p>
