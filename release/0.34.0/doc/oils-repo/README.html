<p>It's written in Python, so the code is short and easy to change.  But we
automatically translate it to C++ with custom tools, to make it fast and small.
The deployed executable doesn't depend on Python.</p>

<h2>Contributing</h2>
<ul>
<li>Try making the <strong>dev build</strong> of Oils with the instructions on the
<a href="https://github.com/oils-for-unix/oils/wiki/Contributing">Contributing</a> page.  This should take 1 to 5 minutes if you have a Linux
machine.</li>
<li>If it doesn't, let us know.  You can post on the <code>#oil-dev</code> channel of
<a href="https://oilshell.zulipchat.com/">oilshell.zulipchat.com</a>, or file an issue on Github.</li>
<li>Feel free to grab an <a href="https://github.com/oils-for-unix/oils/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22">issue from
Github</a>.
Let us know what you're thinking before you get too far.</li>
</ul>
<a name="quick-start-on-linux"></a>
<h3>Quick Start on Linux</h3>
<p>After following the instructions on the <a href="https://github.com/oils-for-unix/oils/wiki/Contributing">Contributing</a> page, you'll have a
Python program that you can quickly run and change!  Try it interactively:</p>
<pre><code>bash$ bin/osh

osh$ name=world
osh$ echo &quot;hello $name&quot;
hello world
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Try running a shell script you wrote with <code>bin/osh myscript.sh</code>.</li>
<li>Try <a href="https://oils.pub/cross-ref.html#YSH">YSH</a> with <code>bin/ysh</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let us know if any of these things don't work!  <a href="https://op.oilshell.org/">The continuous
build</a> tests them at every commit.</p>
<a name="dev-build-vs-release-build"></a>
<h3>Dev Build vs. Release Build</h3>
<p>Again, note that the <strong>developer build</strong> is <strong>very different</strong> from the release
tarball.  The <a href="https://github.com/oils-for-unix/oils/wiki/Contributing">Contributing</a> page describes this difference in detail.</p>
<p>The release tarballs are linked from the <a href="https://oils.pub/">home page</a>.  (Developer
builds don't work on OS X, so use the release tarballs on OS X.)</p>
<a name="important-we-accept-small-contributions"></a>
<h3>Important: We Accept Small Contributions!</h3>
<p>Oils is full of <a href="https://oils.pub/blog/">many ideas</a>, which may be
intimidating at first.</p>
<p>But the bar to contribution is very low.  It's basically a medium size Python
program with many tests, and many programmers know how to change such programs.
It's great for prototyping.</p>
<ul>
<li>For OSH compatibility, I often merge <strong>failing <a href="https://oils.pub/cross-ref.html#spec-test">spec
tests</a></strong>.  You don't even
have to write code!  The tests alone help.  I search for related tests with
<code>grep xtrace spec/*.test.sh</code>, where <code>xtrace</code> is a shell feature.</li>
<li>You only have to make your code work <strong>in Python</strong>.  Plain Python programs
are easy to modify.  The semi-automated translation to C++ is a separate
step, although it often just works.</li>
<li>You can <strong>influence the design</strong> of <a href="https://oils.pub/cross-ref.html#YSH">YSH</a>.  If you have an itch to
scratch, be ambitious.  For example, you might want to show us how to
implement <a href="https://github.com/oils-for-unix/oils/issues/843">nonlinear pipelines</a>.</li>
</ul>
<a name="i-aim-for-24-hour-response-time"></a>
<h3>I aim for 24 hour response time</h3>
<p>Please feel free to ping <code>andychu</code> on Zulip or Github if you're <strong>waiting</strong> for
a pull request review!  (or to ask questions)</p>
<p>Usually I can respond in 24 hours. I might be traveling, in which case I'll
respond with something like <em>I hope to look at this by Tuesday</em>.</p>
<p>I might have also <strong>missed</strong> your Github message, so it doesn't hurt to ping
me.</p>
<p>Thank you for the contributions!</p>

<h2>Docs</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/oils-for-unix/oils/wiki">Wiki</a> has many developer docs.  Feel
free to edit them.  If you make a major change, let us know on Zulip!</p>
<p>If you're confused, the best thing to do is to ask on Zulip and someone should
produce a pointer and/or improve the docs.</p>
<p>Docs for <strong>end users</strong> are linked from each <a href="https://oils.pub/releases.html">release
page</a>.</p>
